        <p>Hi, my name is Joseph Lloyd Costner. I have grown up in Kirtland, New Mexico for nearly 25 years now and
            still
            love it here. I currently go to BYU-Idaho online in hopes that, someday, I will obtain a bachelor's degree
            in Professional Studies. Following this goal is part of my dream in becoming a professional genealogist,
            bringing together families, both living and deceased. I grew up in a family of 2 brothers, 1 sister, and two
            wonderful parents. I love to play and listen to music, read and write books, carve wood, and love to cook.
            This is my first time creating websites for this class, so I look forward to learning more this semester.

        <p>With a diverse people, a unique enviroment, and the most beautiful sunsets, it is little
            wonder that this state is called The Land of Enchantment.
